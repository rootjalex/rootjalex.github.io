      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
        Instruction selection, whereby input code represented in an intermediate representation is
        translated into executable instructions from the target platform, is often the most
        target-dependent component in optimizing compilers. Current approaches include pattern
        matching, which is brittle and tedious to design, or search-based methods, which are
        limited by scalability of the search algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm
        that first abstracts the target platform instructions into high-level uber-instructions,
        with each uber-instruction unifying multiple concrete instructions from the target platform.
        Program synthesis is used to lift input code sequences into semantically equivalent sequences
        of uber-instructions and then to lower from uber-instructions to machine code. Using 21 real-world
        benchmarks, we show that our synthesis-based instruction selection algorithm can generate instruction
        sequences for a hardware target, with the synthesized code performing up to 2.1x faster as compared
        to code generated by a professionally-developed optimizing compiler for the same platform.
