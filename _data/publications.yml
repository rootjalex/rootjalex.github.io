  title: 	Fast Instruction Selection for Fast Digital Signal Processing
  abstract: "<p>
    Modern vector processors support a wide variety of instructions for fixed-point digital
    signal processing. These instructions sup- port a proliferation of rounding, saturating,
    and type conversion modes, and are often fused combinations of more primitive op- erations.
    While these are common idioms in fixed-point signal processing, it is difficult to use
    these operations in portable code. It is challenging for programmers to write down portable
    integer arithmetic in a C-like language that corresponds exactly to one of these instructions,
    and even more challenging for compilers to recognize when these instructions can be used. Our
    system, Pitch- fork, defines a portable fixed-point intermediate representation, FPIR, that
    captures common idioms in fixed-point code. FPIR can be used directly by programmers experienced
    with fixed-point, or Pitchfork can automatically lift from integer operations into FPIR using a
    term-rewriting system (TRS) composed of verified man- ual and automatically-synthesized rules.
    Pitchfork then lowers from FPIR into target-specific fixed-point instructions using a set of
    target-specific TRSs. We show that this approach improves run- time performance of portably-written
    fixed-point signal processing code in Halide, across a range of benchmarks, by geomean 1.31x on x86
    with AVX2, 1.82x on ARM Neon, and 2.44x on Hexagon HVX compared to a standard LLVM-based compiler flow,
    while maintaining or improving existing compile times.

  title: Vector Instruction Selection for Digital Signal Processors Using Program Synthesis
  abstract: "<p>
    Instruction selection, whereby input code represented in an intermediate representation is
    translated into executable instructions from the target platform, is often the most
    target-dependent component in optimizing compilers. Current approaches include pattern
    matching, which is brittle and tedious to design, or search-based methods, which are
    limited by scalability of the search algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm
    that first abstracts the target platform instructions into high-level uber-instructions,
    with each uber-instruction unifying multiple concrete instructions from the target platform.
    Program synthesis is used to lift input code sequences into semantically equivalent sequences
    of uber-instructions and then to lower from uber-instructions to machine code. Using 21 real-world
    benchmarks, we show that our synthesis-based instruction selection algorithm can generate instruction
    sequences for a hardware target, with the synthesized code performing up to 2.1x faster as compared
    to code generated by a professionally-developed optimizing compiler for the same platform.
